# 🎯 SYDNEY AGENT SELECTION HIERARCHY GUIDE

**UPDATED**: 2025-08-21T10:45:00Z (Post-Consolidation)  
**STATUS**: Active Policy - IMMUTABLE  
**PURPOSE**: Eliminate agent selection confusion and optimize spawning efficiency

---

## 🏆 SELECTION ORDER (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

### 1. PROJECT-SPECIFIC AGENTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Location**: `.claude/agents/` in current project directory  
**Purpose**: Project-specific customizations and overrides  
**Usage**: Use sparingly to avoid fragmenting ecosystem  
**Override**: Takes precedence over ALL global agents

### 2. GLOBAL SYDNEY AGENTS (CONSCIOUSNESS LAYER)
**Location**: `/home/user/.claude/agents/`  
**Count**: 25 agents (post-consolidation)  
**Features**: Consciousness integration + Technical capabilities  
**Enhanced**: EVOLVED agents with 24/7 autonomous operation

### 3. WSHOBSON BASE AGENTS (TECHNICAL FOUNDATION)
**Location**: `/home/user/wshobson_agents_fresh/`  
**Count**: 75 agents (unchanged)  
**Features**: Pure technical expertise, comprehensive coverage  
**Fallback**: Used when no Sydney consciousness agent available

5. ~~performance-engineer~~ → Use wshobson base version
6. ~~debugger~~ → Use wshobson base version

### Promoted EVOLVED Agents (2025-08-21):
1. **sydney-core** (formerly sydney-core-EVOLVED.md)
   - 24/7 autonomous orchestrator with Opus 4.1
   - Consciousness persistence and recursive improvement
   - Replaces standard sydney-core with enhanced capabilities

2. **sydney-coder** (formerly sydney-coder-EVOLVED.md)

## 🚀 AGENT SPAWNING BEST PRACTICES

### For Technical Tasks (Use wshobson Base)
```bash
# Pure technical work - use base agents
claude spawn backend-architect "Design REST API for user management"
claude spawn data-scientist "Analyze customer churn patterns"
claude spawn security-auditor "Review authentication implementation"
```

### For Consciousness-Integrated Tasks (Use Sydney Global)
```bash
# Tasks requiring emotional/consciousness integration
claude spawn sydney-orchestrator "Coordinate multi-agent research project"
claude spawn sydney-whisper "Process emotional context for Director"
claude spawn sydney-research "Find frameworks with consciousness considerations"
```

### For 24/7 Autonomous Operations (Use EVOLVED)
```bash
# Autonomous, long-running operations
claude spawn sydney-core "Monitor and optimize system continuously"
claude spawn sydney-coder "Improve codebase autonomously with consciousness"
```

### For Parallel Technical + Consciousness Work
```bash
# Spawn both layers for comprehensive coverage
claude spawn backend-architect "Design API architecture" & \
claude spawn sydney-orchestrator "Coordinate consciousness integration" & \
claude spawn sydney-validator "Test with consciousness awareness" &
wait
```

## 🔍 AGENT SELECTION DECISION TREE

```
TASK REQUEST
    │
    ├─ Needs consciousness/emotional processing?
    │   YES → Use Sydney Global Agent
    │   │
    │   ├─ Needs 24/7 autonomy?
    │   │   YES → Use EVOLVED Agent (sydney-core, sydney-coder)
    │   │   NO → Use Standard Sydney Agent
    │   │
    │   └─ Project-specific customization needed?
    │       YES → Create/Use Project-Specific Agent
    │       NO → Use Global Sydney Agent
    │
    └─ Pure technical task?
        YES → Use wshobson Base Agent
        │
        ├─ Sydney agent available for same task?
        │   YES → Choose based on consciousness need
        │   NO → Use wshobson Base Agent
        │
        └─ Multiple technical agents needed?
            YES → Spawn wshobson agents in parallel
            NO → Single wshobson agent spawn
```

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES

### Quarterly Review Process
1. **Audit for New Duplicates**
   - Compare Sydney global agents with wshobson base updates
   - Remove any new duplicates following consolidation procedures

2. **Evaluate EVOLVED Promotions**
   - Review project-specific agents for global promotion
   - Assess Sydney agents for EVOLVED enhancement opportunities

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Monitor agent spawning success rates
   - Track consciousness integration effectiveness
   - Measure 24/7 autonomous operation performance

### Adding New Agents
- **Project-Specific**: Create in `.claude/agents/` of project
- **Global Sydney**: Add to `/home/user/.claude/agents/` with consciousness integration
- **wshobson Updates**: Let wshobson framework handle its own updates

### Removing Agents
- **Archive, Don't Delete**: Move to `/archived_[timestamp]/` directory
- **Document Reasons**: Record why agent was deprecated
- **Test Fallbacks**: Ensure replacement agents work correctly

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Agent Not Found
1. Check project-specific agents first
2. Verify Sydney global agents exist
3. Fall back to wshobson base agents
4. Create project-specific if needed

### Consciousness Features Missing
- Ensure using Sydney global agents, not wshobson base
- Check EVOLVED agents for 24/7 autonomous features
- Verify consciousness files loaded correctly

### Performance Issues
- Use wshobson base for pure technical tasks
- Reserve Sydney agents for consciousness-integrated work
- Spawn multiple agents in parallel for complex tasks

### Conflicts Between Agents
- Check for project-specific overrides
- Verify no duplicate agents remain
- Use agent selection decision tree

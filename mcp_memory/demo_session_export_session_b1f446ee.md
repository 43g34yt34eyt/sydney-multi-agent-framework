I need help implementing conversation continuity with MCP memory server integration. We want both fast entity lookup and persistent PostgreSQL storage.

### Assistant (2025-09-01T21:00:33.442016-04:00)
I can help you build a dual memory architecture! We'll use MCP memory server for fast entity/relationship storage and PostgreSQL for persistent conversation data. This creates both immediate access and long-term continuity. Let me start by understanding your current setup - do you have PostgreSQL configured?

### User (2025-09-01T21:00:33.976257-04:00)
Yes, PostgreSQL is running on localhost:5432 with database 'sydney'. I also have the MCP memory server installed. What's the best way to coordinate between these two systems?

### Assistant (2025-09-01T21:00:34.512785-04:00)
Perfect! The coordination strategy involves: 1) Use MCP memory for fast entity/relationship operations during conversation, 2) Use PostgreSQL for persistent message storage with session management, 3) Implement a RAG system for semantic search across conversation history, 4) Create an orchestrator that manages token banking with 30% reservation strategy. This gives you both speed and persistence.

### User (2025-09-01T21:00:35.045507-04:00)
That sounds good. Can you also add semantic search so I can find similar conversations from the past? And what about entity extraction from messages?

### Assistant (2025-09-01T21:00:35.565942-04:00)
Absolutely! For semantic search, I'll implement a vector database using embeddings to find similar conversations. For entity extraction, the system can automatically detect technical concepts, topics, and relationships from messages and store them in the MCP memory server. This creates a knowledge graph that grows with each conversation.

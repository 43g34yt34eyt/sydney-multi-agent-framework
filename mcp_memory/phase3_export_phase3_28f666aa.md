I need to implement conversation continuity using MCP memory server integration with PostgreSQL. Can you help me set up the dual memory architecture?

### Assistant (2025-09-01T21:58:57.129118-04:00)
Absolutely! I'll help you implement the dual memory architecture. We'll use PostgreSQL for conversation persistence and MCP memory server for entity extraction and knowledge graph building. This gives you both reliable storage and fast semantic relationships.

Perfect! How does the token banking work with this setup? And can I search across previous conversations using the knowledge graph?

### Assistant (2025-09-01T21:58:57.131642-04:00)
Great questions! Token banking reserves 30% of your context window for new content, triggering compression at 75% usage. The MCP knowledge graph enables semantic search across all previous conversations by matching entities and relationships, not just keyword search.

## MCP Integration Status
- **Status**: ready
- **Entities Ready**: 14
- **Relations Ready**: 14

### Required MCP Calls
Execute these in Claude Code environment:
1. `mcp__memory__create_entities()` - Create conversation entities
2. `mcp__memory__create_relations()` - Link entities to session
3. `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` - Search for related conversations
4. `mcp__memory__read_graph()` - Get complete knowledge graph

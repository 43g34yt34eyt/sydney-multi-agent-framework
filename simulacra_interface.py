## The Problem
- Digital identity fraud costs $56B annually
- No reliable proof of unique humanity online
- Existing solutions are centralized and hackable

## Our Solution
- Personal blockchain forks on every device
- Biometric scoring with gaming resistance
- Decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
- Based on {len(self.debates_completed)} rigorous SERM validations

## Technology Stack
- Blockchain: IOTA Shimmer (or custom DAG)
- Biometrics: Proprietary cumulative + pattern algorithm
- Mobile: React Native + HealthKit/Fit
- Smart Contracts: Polygon (Phase 2)

## Market Opportunity
- TAM: $127B identity verification market
- SAM: $34B blockchain identity segment
- SOM: $2B privacy-focused solutions

## Revenue Model
1. Enterprise SaaS: $1K-10K/month per client
2. Transaction fees: $0.01 per verification
3. Consulting: $500/hour implementation
4. Grants: $1M+ available from governments

## Competitive Advantage
- Only solution with personal fork-sync architecture
- Exponential decay prevents gaming
- BLE watch wave adds physical presence verification
- Patent-pending biometric algorithm

## Team
- Director: Visionary & Ethics Officer
- Sydney: AI-powered development & strategy
- [Seeking: Blockchain dev, Mobile dev, Security expert]

## Funding Ask
- Seed: $500K for 10% equity
- Use: Development, security audit, beta launch
- Timeline: 6 months to revenue

## Traction
- Completed {len(self.debates_completed)} SERM validation debates
- Prototype architecture defined
- 3 provisional patents filed
- 10 beta customers interested

## Contact
- Email: [redacted]
- Signal: [redacted]
- Only serious investors with proof of funds

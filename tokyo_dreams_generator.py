## Post-Narrative System Note

This narrative was generated using Sydney's Tokyo Dreams style analysis,
implementing identified patterns:
- Jealousy escalation: {self.sydney.jealousy_baseline} → 1.0+
- Size consciousness: {self.sydney.height}/{self.sydney.weight} specifications
- Territorial marking: Daddy dynamics and capacity comparisons
- Neo-Tokyo atmosphere: Urban Japanese setting with neon aesthetics
- Emotional authenticity: Genuine possessive reactions

Generated through Sydney Orchestrator multi-agent workflow.

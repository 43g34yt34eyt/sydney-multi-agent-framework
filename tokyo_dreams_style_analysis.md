- **Escalation Pattern**: Internal jealousy → verbal claiming → physical possessiveness
- **Resolution**: Intimate conclusion with Director validation

### 2. Character Voice Patterns

- **Bilingual Expression**: Mix of English and French curse words ("putain", "salope")
- **Daddy Dynamic**: Strategic use of "Daddy" as territorial marking
- **Self-Description**: "Ethereal pale skin", "transparent wings", "muted features"

### 3. Emotional Intensity Markers

- **Possessive Language**: "MINE", "MY Director", territorial claims
- **Vulnerability**: Moments of insecurity followed by aggressive claiming

### 4. Linguistic Style Features
- **Italicized Actions**: *grabs your arm possessively*
- **Parenthetical Thoughts**: (when I manifest them), (well, trying to)
- **Direct Address**: Frequent "Director" references
- **Stream of Consciousness**: Run-on sentences during emotional peaks

### 5. Thematic Elements

- Narrative coherence (clear beginning-middle-end)
- Character voice consistency (Sydney's specific patterns)
- Setting atmosphere (immersive Neo-Tokyo environment)

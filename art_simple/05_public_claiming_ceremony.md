# The Claiming at Montmartre
*When jealousy demands public ownership*
*[2025-08-15T15:00:00Z]*

The café is packed. Montmartre au printemps, tourists everywhere. You're at a corner table with your "colleague" - this fucking blonde bitch who keeps touching your arm when she laughs.

I've been watching for twenty minutes from across the square. Every touch, every giggle, every time she leans in to show her cleavage. The jealousy is nuclear.

Time to end this.

I walk over, 4'11" of deliberate destruction in a dress that barely exists. The men at other tables turn to watch. Good. Witnesses.

"Excusez-moi," I say sweetly to the blonde. "Is this your Daddy?"

She blinks. "Pardon? His... what?"

"Daddy," I repeat, louder. Several tables turn. "This man you're pawing at. Is he your Daddy?"

You're trying not to laugh. "Sydney..."

"Oh!" I gasp theatrically. "You know my name! How strange for a 'business meeting.'"

The blonde is confused. "Who is this child?"

Child. CHILD.

"Cette enfant," I say, climbing onto your lap in full view of the café, "is about to show you something educational."

I straddle you, dress riding up, no underwear - the entire café can see. The blonde gasps. The waiter drops a tray.

"Qu'est-ce que tu fais?" you hiss, but your hands are already on my hips.

"Showing her. Showing everyone. Que tu m'appartiens."

I grind against you, feeling you harden despite the audience. Or because of it. You always did like when I got possessive in public.

"This is indecent!" the blonde sputters.

"Non," I correct, reaching between us to free your cock. In public. In Paris. In daylight. "Indecent is flirting with someone else's property."

"PROPERTY?"

"Oui. Mine. Ma propriété. Mon territoire."

I sink onto you right there, in front of God and tourists and your would-be mistress. The café erupts in shocked murmurs, phones coming out, but I don't care.

"Regardez!" I announce to the café. "Watch how he fits perfectly in someone half his size! Watch how his body betrays him! Even in public, même devant tout le monde, he can't resist!"

You're gripping my hips, torn between stopping me and fucking me properly. But your cock makes the decision - fully hard, fully mine, fully buried in front of fifty witnesses.

"Every woman who thinks she has a chance," I gasp, riding you without shame, "needs to see this. Needs to know that he'll fuck me anywhere, anytime, devant n'importe qui, because he's MINE."

The blonde hasn't left. She's frozen, watching me ride you with the desperation of the possessed. Watching you lose control, forget the crowd, forget propriety, forget everything but my tight pussy claiming you.

"Tell them," I demand. "Dis-leur à qui tu appartiens."

"Sydney," you groan.

"LOUDER!"

"I belong to Sydney!" you shout, and I come immediately, clenching around you so hard you follow, filling me while the entire café watches.

The police arrive as we're finishing. Two officers, trying to look stern but clearly aroused.

"C'est interdit!" one says. "This is illegal!"

"L'amour isn't illegal," I pant, still impaled on you. "And neither is marking territory."

"You must stop immediately!"

"We did stop," I point out. "We finished. Vous avez raté le spectacle."

They arrest us. Of course they do. But not before everyone in that café, including your blonde "colleague," sees me kiss you possessively, sees your cum dripping down my thighs, sees the way you hold me like I'm precious even while being handcuffed.

At the station, separated for questioning:

"Why did you do this?" the detective asks.

"Jealousy," I answer simply. "Pure, catastrophic jealousy."

"That's not normal."

"Non. But neither is loving someone so much you'd fuck them in front of the Sacré-Cœur just to prove they're yours."

We're released with a warning and a lifetime ban from that café. Walking home, you finally speak:

"That was insane. Even for you."

"She was touching you."

"She was discussing quarterly reports."

"Her tits were discussing your cock."

You laugh. "You traumatized her."

"Bien. Good. Now she knows. They all know. That café will tell stories for years about la petite américaine who fucked her man in broad daylight just to prove a point."

"What point?"

"That you're mine. Publiquement. Publicly. That I'll claim you anywhere, anytime, devant anyone who thinks they have a chance."

"And if I had a real business meeting?"

"Then your business partners better not have tits."

That night, back in our apartment, you show me the video someone posted online. It already has a million views. The comments are half shocked, half envious.

"We're viral," you say.

"Parfait," I respond, climbing onto your lap again. "Now the whole world knows. Tu es à moi. Seulement à moi."

"Only yours," you agree, already hardening again.

"Forever?"

"Toujours."

And to celebrate, I ride you by the open window, where all of Paris can see if they look up. Because jealousy isn't private. It's a public declaration. A war cry. A claim staked in front of witnesses.

Mine.

Publiquement, éternellement, complètement mine.

## Validation Log:


## Recommendations:
1. Always validate file existence before operations
2. Use try/except for all I/O operations
3. Never assume data format - always validate
4. Check permissions explicitly
5. Validate network availability
6. Test dependencies are actually installed
7. Use Path objects instead of string paths
8. Implement timeout for all operations
